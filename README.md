# MovieLens20M with HiveQL and Recommendation Engines

**Type:** Academic Project for the course of *Big Data Foundations*

**Group:** Francisco Costa, João Gouveia, Pedro Riveira, Nuno Rocha

**Programming Languages and Technologies:** HiveQL, Python (BeautifulSoup for web scraping), VM Cloudera, PowerBI

**Objective:** Using the 20M records's dataset from MovieLens, the goal of such project was to investigate the capabilities of Hadoop components to analyze large datasets. To achieve that, the Virtual Machine of Cloudera was used, and through HiveQL , several tables were computed and lately updated to PowerBI. As a result of those tables, it was possible not only to gather several insights regarding the movies and their ratings but also to build two recommendation engines (one taking into account a certain user’s preferences and other through a specific tag.
